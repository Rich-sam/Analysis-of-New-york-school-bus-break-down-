The Bus Breakdown and Delay program gathers real-time information from school bus vendors that work in the region. Bus workers facing delays along the trip are advised to contact the dispatcher to the central office of the bus supplier. To record the event and inform OPT, the bus vendor staff are then instructed to log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay program. This program is used by OPT customer service representatives to notify parents who are calling with bus service queries. The Bus Breakdown and Delay program is available to the public and provides alerts in real time. All information is entered by vendor employees of school buses in the network.
